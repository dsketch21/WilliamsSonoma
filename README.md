# Dustin Cooper - Williams Sonoma Take Home

This page was created as part of a take home tech test for Williams Sonoma. This application was developed using an express server to serve up the built application on a Heroku server. The application is built with Webpack, Babel, React, Redux, SASS and of course HTML5. The page has been optimized for search engines by including a title tag, meta description, meta keywords and alt and title tags on the images. There are toggles in the footer that allows you to switch storage engines from session storage to local storage. The selected products will refresh upon changing the data storage engine to draw the selected products saved in that storage type. The product grid is responsive and will split the screen upon selecting a given product from the selectable product grid.
